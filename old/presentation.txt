NES
	Presentation will cover pretty much graphics only, try for user input...time permitting...

Outline:
	Graphical Capabilities and Limitations  5 min
		-Screen:
			-256x240 resolution.
			-Horizontal scanlines (240 of them).
		-Sprites:
			-8x8 sprites and 8x16 sprites.
				-8x16 sprites are technically just two memory locations, must start on an even sprite index.
					-This makes ALL sprites 8x16, so sprites that are 8x8 waste memory.
			-64 sprites on the screen at one time (without flickering).
			-8 sprites per scanline.
			-4 colors per sprite (technically 3, other is usually transparent).
				-Big deal over megaman having 5 colors.
					-Not magic, just sprites being drawn on top of one another...
		-Colors:
			-Store up to 48-palettes.
			-Max of 50 colors total.
			-25 colors max per scanline.
				-Note, each sprite can have up to 3 colors, 8*3=24, which is the max-1.
